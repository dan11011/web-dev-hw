# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Daniel Ostersmith
I have decided to take this class because I am will be in Germany for the summer working on an internship at a Bear Sanctuary and wanted to find a class that I could take online. This class in some ways is the total definition of an 'online' class. I am excited to learn more about web design and development.

* I was interested to learn that a lot of people don't know a lot about the internet and how it works. To be honest, I am one of them.
* It was also interesting to be reminded how relatively new the internet is.
