<hr />
<p> DAYS
</p>

<br />
DAMSELS of Time, the hypocritic Days,<br />
Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes,<br />
And marching single in an endless file,<br />
Bring diadems and fagots in their hands.<br />
To each they offer gifts after his will,<br />
Bread, kingdoms, stars, and sky that holds them all.<br />
I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,<br />
Forgot my morning wishes, hastily<br />
Took a few herbs and apples, and the Day<br />
Turned and departed silent. I, too late,<br />
Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.<br />
