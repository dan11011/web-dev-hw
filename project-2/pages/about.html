        <h1>Fake Meat</h1>
        <p>
        My parents decided they wanted to become vegetarians before they had
          my brother or I so as a result I grew up vegetarian. My mom is quite
          a creative cook which makes vegetarian cooking fun and exciting.
          As you may have noticed, there are more and more vegetarian meat
          alternative options in grocery stores these days. You can find 'fake'
          bacon, sausage, hot dogs, ribs, chicken, and even turkey with a little
          searching around at your grocery store. These are all great options
          and usually can be quite high in protein and low in fat which is great.
          However, sometimes it's fun to create or make your own meat alternatives.</p>
          <p>
            Eggplant is pretty well known for being a vegetable that when prepared
            in certain ways has a texture and consistency similar to meat. This
            is especially intriguing for people who previously ate meat and are
            trying to cut back. Eggplant can give a similar 'satisfaction' that
            some people crave from meat, all while being much healthier and less
            imapactful on the evironment. Obviously eggplant doesn't have a lot
            of protein, but that's where quinoa, rice and beans, nuts, and soy
            comes in.</p>
          <p>
            This recipe I found is fun, relatively simple, and makes for a delicious
            dinner. I hope you try it out! Why not?!</p>
