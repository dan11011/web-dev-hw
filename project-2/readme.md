<h1>Technical Report</h1>
<p>Using html in this assignment, was the first time that parts of the process felt familiar. I still had to look back to remember how to do things like embed a google maps location or use 'style' but the process as a whole felt familiar. I used a recipe that I have made and found online. It was fun to talk about vegetarian cooking and eating.</p>
<p>In the next topic I am a little worried about learning new material and applying it to an assignment as all of this material takes time to grapple. However, I am sure it will be interesting to learn.</p>
<p>
This assignment went relatively smoothly. It still took me a lot longer than I expected but I am pretty happy with the finished product.</p>
