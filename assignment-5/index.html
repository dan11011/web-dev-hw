<h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
Raindrops are falling on my head <br>
And just like the guy Whose feet are too big for his bed <br>
Nothing Seems to fit  <br>
Those raindrops are falling on my head, They keep falling<br>
So I just did me some talking to the sun <br>
And I said I did not like the way he got things done <br>
Sleeping on the job <br>
Those raindrops are falling on my head, They keep fallin '<br>
But there's one thing I know <br>
The blues they send to me <br>
Will not defeat me, it will not be long <br>
'Till happiness steps up to greet me<br>
Raindrops keep falling on my head <br>
But did does not mean my eyes will soon be turning red <br>
Crying's not for me <br>
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining <br>
Because I'm free <br>
Nothing's worrying me <br>
It will not be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me <br>
Raindrops keep falling on my head <br>
But did does not mean my eyes will soon be turning red <br>
Crying's not for me <br>
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining <br>
Because I'm free,' cause nothing's worrying me <br>
