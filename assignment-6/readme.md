<p>I googled 50's colors and found lots of muted palletes. I found some Sear's catalogue style photos on the internet and this is what inspired me to try and use dull and muted colors. Things were colorful in this area but not bright. I really liked the star style image I used and wanted it to be the main point of attraction on my page. It was somewhat difficult to position parts of the page. I chose two little 50's sayings that I also wanted to add in, 'Back Seat Bingo', and 'Ring a Ding Ding'.</p>
<p>The colors I used were #eaf1d0, rgb(79, 142, 136), and #d0d0d0 - rgb(208, 208, 208). I wanted my color to all be colorful but also kind of dull.</p>

Considing this assignment was almost all completely new material, it took me quite a while to complete. I am feeling more comfortable with html and find that it is more satisfying to work with alone than adding CSS. Hopefully the next assignment seems more familiar. 1950s!! Oh Yeah!!!
