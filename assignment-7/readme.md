<p>I chose the excerpt from the Shinning and wanted a mysterious but clean feel to my page. I chose Oswald, Kumar One Outline, and Comic Sans MS as my fonts for this assignment.</p>
<p>A system font is a font already installed on your device. A web font are custom fonts hosted on a server and aren't necessarily available directly on your device but are rather called up to be displayed from the web. Web-safe fonts are that are safe to use on different systems like both Windows and Mac. These fonts will be available to almost all users, regardless of the device they are using.</p>
<p>Fall-back fonts are fonts that are used if the primary font is unavailable for a certain device. The fall-back fonts will be used automatically if necessary.</p>

I was a little nervous with this assignment because I knew it would also be all new material. The fact that it dealt with text rather than style was a little reassuring as I feel like I can mentally grasp that. Little did I know, typography is almost as complicated ;). I did enjoy reading my little excerpt though, as I love the movie. On to the next !!</p>
