<p>A system font is a font already installed on your device. A web font are custom fonts hosted on a server and aren't necessarily available directly on your device but are rather called up to be displayed from the web. Web-safe fonts are that are safe to use on different systems like both Windows and Mac. These fonts will be available to almost all users, regardless of the device they are using.</p>
<p>Fall-back fonts are fonts that are used if the primary font is unavailable for a certain device. The fall-back fonts will be used automatically if necessary.</p>
