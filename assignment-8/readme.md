<p> Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself. The Margin is the space between the box/element and other elements.

Border is more of a visual styling tool, than a space management tool.</p>

I feel like I have learned a lot over this course and feel like I have gained a lot of skills to make some pretty interesting sites going forward. If a friend asked for me to build a basic site, I now feel like I could! Which is pretty cool! </p>
